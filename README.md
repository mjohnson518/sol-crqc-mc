# Solana Quantum Impact Monte Carlo Simulation

## Overview

This Monte Carlo simulation models the probabilistic impact of quantum computing advances on the Solana blockchain network. It evaluates when cryptographically relevant quantum computers (CRQC) might emerge, how they could compromise Solana's security, and what economic impacts would result.
