## Core Economic Values

### Current Market Parameters (September 2025)

| Parameter | Value | Source | Update Frequency |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| SOL Price | $246.50 | CoinGecko | Real-time |
| Total Staked SOL | 411M SOL | Solana RPC | Real-time |
| Total Value Locked (TVL) | $12.7B | [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/chain/solana) | Real-time |
| Stablecoins in TVL | $12.5B | [DeFiLlama](https://defillama.com/stablecoins/Solana) | Real-time |
| Validators | 993 | [Solana Beach](https://solanabeach.io/validators) | Real-time |
| Market Cap | $134B | Calculated | Real-time |

### Calculated Risk Exposure (Realistic Model)

#### Attack Loss Calculation
```
Attack Loss = TVL × Risk Percentage
Attack Loss = $12.7B × 0.25 (25% of TVL at risk)
Attack Loss = $3.175B
```

**Note: 98% of TVL is in stablecoins ($12.5B/$12.7B), making this value highly liquid and attractive to attackers.**

#### Expected Value Calculation
```
Expected Loss = Attack Loss × CRQC Probability
Expected Loss = $3.175B × 0.15 (15% probability over 10 years)
Expected Loss = $476M
```

### Attack Scenario Analysis

**Historical Attack Analysis:**
- Typical major attacks: $100M - $1B (actual funds lost)
- Catastrophic attacks: $1B - $3B maximum observed
- Ronin Bridge (2022): $625M stolen (7% of Axie ecosystem)
- FTX collapse (2022): $8B lost (but centralized exchange, not DeFi)

**TVL-Based Risk Assessment:**
1. **Total Value Locked**: $12.7B (actual at-risk value in DeFi)
2. **Stablecoin Concentration**: $12.5B (98%) - extremely liquid
3. **Realistic Attack Scenario**: 25% of TVL compromised ($3.2B)
4. **Not All Protocols Fail**: Distributed risk across ecosystem
5. **Market Cap Irrelevant**: Focus on extractable value (TVL)
6. **Expected Value**: Probability-weighted for decision making

## Migration Cost Calculations

### Base Migration Cost
```
Migration Cost = Component-based Analysis (not percentage)
Hardware Acceleration: $22.5M
Development Effort: $10M  
Security Auditing: $4M
Validator Coordination: $6M
Contingency Reserve: $5M
Total Migration Cost = $47.5M
```

The **$47.5M figure** is based on actual component costs:

**Hardware Acceleration ($22.5M):**
- GPU/FPGA infrastructure for 1,017 validators
- 1.5-2x speedup for quantum-safe signatures
- Quick deployment (3-6 months)

**Development Effort ($10M):**
- 20 engineers for 24 months
- Core protocol modifications
- Quantum-safe algorithm implementation
- Migration tooling and testing

**Security Auditing ($4M):**
- 3 independent audit firms
- Formal verification
- Bug bounty program

**Validator Coordination ($6M):**
- Incentive programs
- Technical support
- Documentation and training

**Contingency ($5M):**
- 15% buffer for unexpected costs

**Total: $47.5M (0.05% of protected value)**

This is more realistic than percentage-based estimates:
- Bitcoin SegWit: ~$30M
- Ethereum Constantinople: ~$25M  
- Zcash Sapling: ~$15M

### Return on Investment (ROI)
```
ROI = (Benefit - Cost) / Cost × 100%
ROI = ($476M - $47.5M) / $47.5M × 100%
ROI = $428.5M / $47.5M × 100%
ROI = 901%
```

### Benefit-Cost Ratio
```
B/C = Total Benefits / Total Costs
B/C = $476M / $47.5M
B/C = 10.0 ≈ 10:1
```

## Risk Scenarios

### Attack Probability Distribution

| Scenario | Loss Amount | Probability | Expected Value |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| No Attack | $0 | 85% | $0 |
| Minor Attack | $500M | 10% | $50M |
| Major Attack | $3.2B | 4% | $128M |
| Catastrophic | $12.7B (entire TVL) | 1% | $127M |
| **Total Expected Value** | - | 100% | **$305M** |

### Additional Risk Metrics

#### Understanding Expected Value

**Expected Value** answers: "What is the probability-weighted average loss?"
- Accounts for both probability and impact
- Standard decision-making metric
- $319M expected loss over 10 years

**Worst Case Scenario** answers: "What if everything goes wrong?"
- Total TVL loss: $8.5B
- Extremely low probability (< 1%)
- Would require complete network compromise
- Historical precedent: No blockchain has lost 100% TVL from quantum attack

#### Break-Even Analysis
```
Break-Even Point = Migration Cost / Annual Risk Reduction
Annual Risk = $319M / 10 years = $31.9M/year
Break-Even = $47.5M / $31.9M = 1.5 years
```

**Key Insights:**
- Migration pays for itself in 1.5 years
- Every year of delay costs ~$32M in expected value
- Strong economic case even with conservative assumptions

#### Sensitivity Analysis
```
If CRQC probability = 10%: Expected loss = $318M, ROI = 569%
If CRQC probability = 20%: Expected loss = $635M, ROI = 1,237%
If TVL at risk = 15%: Expected loss = $286M, ROI = 502%
If TVL at risk = 35%: Expected loss = $667M, ROI = 1,304%
```

**Critical Note:** With 98% of TVL in stablecoins ($12.5B), this value is:
- Highly liquid and easily transferable
- Prime target for attackers (immediate value extraction)
- Less subject to price volatility during attacks

## Time-Based Impact Calculations

### Annual Risk Exposure
```
Annual Risk = Expected Loss / Time Horizon
Annual Risk = $476M / 10 years
Annual Risk = $47.6M per year
```

### Cost of Delay
```
Monthly Delay Cost = Annual Risk / 12
Monthly Delay Cost = $47.6M / 12
Monthly Delay Cost = $3.97M per month
```
